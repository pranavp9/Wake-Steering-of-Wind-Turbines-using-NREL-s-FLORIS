# Wake-Steering-of-Wind-Turbines-using-NREL-s-FLORIS

1. Increased 3x3 wind farm output by 18.5\% using NREL's FLORIS library in Python with optimum yaw angles to each wind turbine
2. Studied 4 wake models, fatigue life of turbine, optimal power outputs for 3x3 wind farm caused by yaw misalignment of wind turbines
